<h2 align='center'>Differentiable GPU-capable solvers for CDEs</h2>

This library provides differentiable GPU-capable solvers for controlled differential equations (CDEs). Backpropagation through the solver or via the adjoint method is supported; the latter allows for improved memory efficiency.

In particular this allows for building [Neural Controlled Differential Equation](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/NeuralCDE) models, which are state-of-the-art models for (arbitrarily irregular!) time series. Neural CDEs can be thought of as a "continuous time RNN".

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/patrick-kidger/torchcde.git
```

Requires PyTorch >=1.6.

## Example
We encourage looking at [example.py](./example/example.py), which demonstrates how to use the library to train a Neural CDE model to predict the chirality of a spiral.

Also see [irregular_data.py](./example/irregular_data.py), for demonstrations on how to handle variable-length inputs, irregular sampling, or missing data, all of which can be handled easily, without changing the model.

A short self contained example:
```python
import torch
import torchcde

# Create some data
batch, length, input_channels = 1, 10, 2
hidden_channels = 3
t = torch.linspace(0, 1, length)
t_ = t.unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(-1).expand(batch, length, 1)
x_ = torch.rand(batch, length, input_channels - 1)
x = torch.cat([t_, x_], dim=2)  # include time as a channel

# Interpolate it
coeffs = torchcde.natural_cubic_spline_coeffs(x)
X = torchcde.NaturalCubicSpline(coeffs)

# Create the Neural CDE system
class F(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(F, self).__init__()
        self.linear = torch.nn.Linear(hidden_channels, 
                                      hidden_channels * input_channels)
    def forward(self, t, z):
        return self.linear(z).view(batch, hidden_channels, input_channels)

func = F()
z0 = torch.rand(batch, hidden_channels)

# Integrate it
torchcde.cdeint(X=X, func=func, z0=z0, t=X.interval)
```

## Documentation

The library consists of two main components: (1) integrators for solving controlled differential equations, and (2) ways of constructing controls from data.

### Integrators

The library provides the `cdeint` function, which solves the system of controlled differential equations:
```
dz(t) = f(t, z(t))dX(t)     z(t_0) = z0
```

The goal is to find the response `z` driven by the control `X`. This can be re-written as the following differential equation:
```
dz/dt(t) = f(t, z)dX/dt(t)     z(t_0) = z0
```
where the right hand side describes a matrix-vector product between `f(t, z)` and `dX/dt(t)`.

This is solved by
```python
cdeint(X, func, z0, t, adjoint, **kwargs)
```
where letting `...` denote an arbitrary number of batch dimensions:
* `X` is a `torch.nn.Module` with method `derivative`, such that `X.derivative(t)` is a Tensor of shape `(..., input_channels)`,
* `func` is a `torch.nn.Module`, such that `func(t, z)` returns a Tensor of shape `(..., hidden_channels, input_channels)`,
* `z0` is a Tensor of shape `(..., hidden_channels)`,
* `t` is a one-dimensional Tensor of times to output `z` at.
* `adjoint` is a boolean (defaulting to `True`).

Adjoint backpropagation (which is slower but more memory efficient) can be toggled with `adjoint=True/False` and any additional `**kwargs` are passed on to `torchdiffeq.odeint[_adjoint]`, for example to specify the solver.

### Constructing controls

 A very common scenario is to construct the continuous control`X` from discrete data (which may be irregularly sampled with missing values). To support this, we provide three main interpolation schemes:
 
* Natural cubic splines
* Linear interpolation
* Rectilinear interpolation

_Note that if for some reason you already have a continuous control `X` then you won't need an interpolation scheme at all!_

Natural cubic splines are usually the best choice, if your data isn't arriving continuously over time. (Natural cubic splines aren't causal, so you need to have all your data up-front.) This is what was used in the original [Neural CDE paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08926). If causality is a concern then one of the two linear interpolations should be used, see the [Further Documentation](#further-documentation) below.

Just demonstrating natural cubic splines for now:
```python
coeffs = natural_cubic_spline_coeffs(x)

# coeffs is a torch.Tensor you can save, load,
# pass through Datasets and DataLoaders etc.

X = NaturalCubicSpline(coeffs)
```
where:
* `x` is a Tensor of shape `(..., length, input_channels)`, where `...` is some number of batch dimensions. Missing data should be represented as a `NaN`.

The interface provided by `NaturalCubicSpline` is:

* `.interval`, which gives the time interval the spline is defined over. (Often used as the `t` argument in `cdeint`.) This is determined implicitly from the length of the data, and so does _not_ in general correspond to the time your data was actually observed at. (See the [Further Documentation](#further-documentation) note on reparameterisation invariance.)
* `.grid_points` is all of the knots in the spline, so that for example `X.evaluate(X.grid_points)` will recover the original data.
* `.evaluate(t)`, where `t` is an any-dimensional Tensor, to evaluate the spline at any (collection of) time(s).
* `.derivative(t)`, where `t` is an any-dimensional Tensor, to evaluate the derivative of the spline at any (collection of) time(s).

Usually `natural_cubic_spline_coeffs` should be computed as a preprocessing step, whilst `NaturalCubicSpline` should be called inside the forward pass of your model. See [example.py](./example/example.py) for a worked example.

Then call:
```python
cdeint(X=X, func=... z0=..., t=X.interval)
```

## Differences to `controldiffeq`
If you've used the previous [`controldiffeq`](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/NeuralCDE/tree/master/controldiffeq) library then a couple things have been changed. See [DIFFERENCES.md](./DIFFERENCES.md).

## Extending the library
If you're interested in extending `torchcde` then have a look at [EXTENDING.md](./EXTENDING.md) for extra help on how to do this.

## Further documentation
The earlier documentation section should give everything you need to get up and running.

Here we discuss a few more advanced bits of functionality:
* The reparameterisation invariance property of CDEs.
* Other interpolation methods, and the differences between them.
* The use of fixed solvers. (They just work.)
* Stacking CDEs (i.e. controlling one by the output of another).
* Computing logsignatures for the log-ODE method.

#### Reparameterisation invariance
This is a classical fact about CDEs.

We see that <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cwidetilde%7Bz%7D"> **also** satisfies the neural CDE equation, just with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cwidetilde%7BX%7D"> as input instead of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X">. In other words, using <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\psi"> changes the speed at which we traverse the input <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X">, and correspondingly changes the speed at which we traverse the output <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z"> -- and that's it! In particular the CDE itself doesn't need any adjusting.

This ends up being a really useful fact for writing neater software. We can handle things like messy data (e.g. variable length time series) just during data preprocessing, without it complicating the model code. In [example.py](/example/example.py), the region we integrate over is given by `X.interval` as a standardised region to integrate over. In the example [irregular_data.py](/example/irregular_data.py), we use this to handle variable-length data.

#### Different interpolation methods
In brief:
 * Do you need causality?
   * No: natural cubic splines.
   * Yes: Is your data multivariate with missing values?
     * No: linear interpolation
     * Yes: rectilinear interpolation.
     
In more detail:
     
* Natural cubic splines: the fastest approach.

These were a simple choice used in the original Neural CDE paper. They are non-causal, but are very smooth, which makes them easy to integrate and thus fast to use in the differential equation solvers. These are usually the best choice if you don't need causality.
```python
coeffs = natural_cubic_splines_coeffs(x)
X = NaturalCubicSpline(coeffs)
cdeint(X=X, ...)
```

* Linear interpolation: these are "kind-of" causal.

If your data has just irregular sampling (but not missing data) then these are suitable: at inference you can wait at each time point for the next data point to arrive, then interpolate towards the next data point when it arrives, and solve the CDE over that interval. 

If there is missing data, however, then this isn't possible. (As some of the channels don't have observations you can interpolate to.) In this case use rectilinear interpolation, below.

Linear interpolation has kinks. If using adaptive solvers then it should be told about the kinks. (Rather than expensively finding them for itself -- slowing down to resolve the kink, and then speeding up again afterwards.) This is done with the `grid_points` and `eps` arguments:
```python
coeffs = linear_interpolation_coeffs(x)
X = LinearInterpolation(coeffs)
cdeint(X=X, ...,
       method='dopri5',
       options=dict(grid_points=X.grid_points, eps=1e-5))
```

* Rectilinear interpolation: This is appropriate if there is missing data, and you need causality.

What is done is to linearly interpolate forward in time (keeping the observations constant), and the linearly interpolate the values (keeping the time constant). This is possible because time is a channel (and the "time" of the differential equation doesn't matter, by the reparameterisation invariance of the previous section).

```python
t = torch.linspace(0, 1, 10)
x = torch.rand(2, 10, 3)
t_ = t.unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(-1).expand(2, 10, 1)
x = torch.cat([t_, x], dim=-1)
# `rectilinear` is the channel index corresponding to time
coeffs = linear_interpolation_coeffs(x, rectilinear=0)
X = LinearInterpolation(coeffs)
cdeint(X=X, ...,
       method='dopri5',
       options=dict(grid_points=X.grid_points, eps=1e-5))
```

As before we should inform the solver about kinks.

This can be a bit unintuitive at first. We suggest firing up matplotlib and plotting things to get a feel for what's going on.


#### Fixed solvers
Solving CDEs (regardless of the choice of interpolation scheme in a Neural CDE) with fixed solvers like `euler`, `midpoint`, `rk4` etc. is pretty much exactly the same as solving an ODE with a fixed solver. Just make sure to set the `step_size` option to something sensible; for example the smallest gap between times:
```python
X = LinearInterpolation(coeffs)
step_size = (X.grid_points[1:] - X.grid_points[:-1]).min()
cdeint(
    X=X, t=X.interval, func=..., method='rk4',
    options=dict(step_size=step_size)
)
``` 

#### Stacking CDEs
You may wish to use the output of one CDE to control another. That is, to solve the coupled CDEs:
```
du(t) = g(t, u(t)dz(t)      u(t_0) = u0
dz(t) = f(t, z(t))dX(t)     z(t_0) = z0
```

There are two ways to do this. The first way is to put everything inside a single `cdeint` call, by solving the system
```
v = [u, z]
v0 = [u0, z0]
h(t, v) = [g(t, u)f(t, z), f(t, z)]

dv(t) = h(t, v(t))dX(t)      v(t_0) = v0
```
and using `cdeint` as normal. This is usually the best way to do it! It's simpler and usually faster. (But forces you to use the same solver for the whole system, for example.)

The second way is to have `cdeint` output `z(t)` at multiple times `t`, interpolate the discrete output into a continuous path, and then call `cdeint` again. This is probably less memory efficient, but allows for different choices of solver for each call to `cdeint`.

_For example, this could be used to create multi-layer Neural CDEs, just like multi-layer RNNs. Although as of writing this, no-one seems to have tried this yet!_

#### The log-ODE method
This is a way of reducing the length of data by using extra channels. (For example, this may help train Neural CDE models faster, as the extra channels can be parallelised, but extra length cannot.)

This is done by splitting the control `X` up into windows, and computing the _logsignature_ of the control over each window. The logsignature is a transform known to extract the information that is most important to describing how `X` controls a CDE.

This is supported by the `logsignature_windows` function, which takes in data, and produces a transformed path, that now exists in logsignature space:
```python
batch, length, channels = 1, 100, 2
x = torch.rand(batch, length, channels)
depth, window = 3, 0.2
x, t = logsignature_windows(x, depth, window)
# use x and t as you would normally: interpolate, etc.
# note that t is regularly spaced and can likely be ignored for most purposes
```

See the paper [Neural CDEs for Long Time Series via the Log-ODE Method](https://github.com/jambo6/neuralCDEs-via-logODEs) for more information.

_Note that this requires installing the [Signatory](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/signatory) package._
